# Release Notes Test

This repo is a small playground to try out GitHub's generated release notes feature.

Specifically, using labels on PRs to create sections in the automatically generated release notes. And then maybe after that we'll see about pulling the release notes out and putting them into a CHANGELOG.md file.
