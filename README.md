# Release Notes Test

This repo is a small playground to try out GitHub's generated release notes feature.

Specifically, using labels on PRs to create sections in the automatically generated release notes. When creating a new PR, a default label will be added, and the Fastlane release script will update the CHANGES.md file after making the release.
